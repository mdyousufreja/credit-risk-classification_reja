Module 20 Challenge


## Challenge Overview ##

The objective of this analysis is to utilize a supervised machine learning method, namely logistic regression, for the training and evaluation of a model designed to categorize loans into two groups: those with a healthy risk profile and those considered high-risk loans.

In the first part of the analysis, my goal is to predict the loan status of borrowers. To achieve this, I initially divided the entire dataset into training and testing sets using the **train_test_split** function imported from **sklearn.model_selection**. The training set was employed for building the logistic regression model, and subsequently, I applied this model to the testing set. The model's objective was to determine whether the loans in the testing set could be classified as low or high risk.
